  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  Using Node.js, this application helps with creating a README file for your github repositories. This will allow the user to answer specific questions and create a complete and professional README using their responses. 
 
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  Run 'npm install' for the dependencies inquirer, fs and util. This will allow the questions in the command line prompts to create the README file.
  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  Run the command 'node index' in the terminal and the app will start asking you questions for the README. All responses will be converted to the markdown format and the fs.write package will create the README.md file upon completion. Here is a video showing the process from beginning to end.
